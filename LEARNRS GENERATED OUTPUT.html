<p align="center" style="color:#E9C891">I think that I shall never see<br>
A poem lovely as a tree
<p align="center" style="color:#F90716">A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br>
Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;</p>
<p align="center" style="color:#F76E11>A tree that looks at God all day,<br>
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p>
<p align="center" style="color:#F76E11">A tree that may in Summer wear<br>
A nest of robins in her hair;</p>
<p align="center" style="color:#8843F2">Upon whose bosom snow has lain,<br>
Who intimately lives with rain.;</p>
<p align="center" style="color:#041C32">Poems are made by fools like me,<br>
But only God can make a tree.;</p>
