<h1>Pork Sinigang</h1>
<h2><i>Sinigang is a Filipino soup or stew with a sour and savory flavor. It is most commonly associated with tamarind, but other sour fruits and leaves can be used as the souring agent.</i></h2>
<p>This recipe is better because it uses 3 tablespoon of fish sauce which adds more flavor</p>

<p><b>Sinigang</b> na Hipon - is a type of Filipino sour soup, wherein shrimp is used as the main ingredient. This dish also includes a variety of vegetables such as daikon radish, snake beans, okra, and eggplant. This dish is best served during cold weather. It is best enjoyed hot with a cup of white rice.</p>
<p><b>Sinigang</b> na Salmon - is translated as Salmon head cooked in a sour broth of tomatoes and tamarind (other souring agents such as bilimbi and guava can be used). <b>Sinigang</b> is the term used to cook meat or seafood by boiling it with a sour base such as tamarind. Other variant bases are available depending on the region where sinigang is cooked.</p>
<p><b>Sinigang</b> na Miso - Compared to ordinary fish sinigang, this <b>sinigang</b> na bangus sa miso has richer flavor. There is an element of umami (savoriness) in every bite. The miso (or soybean paste) is regarded in adding the interesting flavor to this dish. I like <b>sinigang</b>, in general. <b>Sinigang</b> na Bangus sa Miso is my favorite among all the seafood <b>sinigang</b> dishes. I enjoy its rich taste and balanced flavor.<p>
<h3><b>Sinigang</b> na Baboy</h3>
<p>This recipe uses pork as the main ingredient. Other proteins and seafood can also be used. Beef, shrimp, fish are commonly used to cook <b>sinigang</b>. The chicken version, on the other hand, is called sinampalukang manok.</p>
